	<h1>All about Kramer Straube</h1>
	<p>I'm a graduate student in Computer Engineering at UC Davis. My research is focused on
	FPGA-emulation of many-core computer systems and system-level architecture of asynchronous processor systems.
	
	I went to college at Harvey Mudd College and studied general engineering. Harvey Mudd doesn't have specialized degree programs.
	Instead, Harbey Mudd believes in providing a larger base of knowledge since many engineering problems nowadays are
	interdiscplinary.
	
	Enough about education... You can always read my <a href="/cv">resume</a>.
	
	In my free time, I play Ultimate Frisbee for the UC Davis Dogs. I am a big fan of board games, video games and my golden retriever Callie.
