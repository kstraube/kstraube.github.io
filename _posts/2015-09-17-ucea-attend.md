I recently attended the UC Entrepreneurship Academy ([UCEA](http://gsm.ucdavis.edu/uc-entrepreneurship-academy)) at UC Davis! It was a great experience!
I really valued the experience of talking to the mentors that they brought in.
Their insight along with the advice from the speakers was extremely valuable.
While I didn't have an idea, I gained plenty of knowledge about the process especially in the interpersonal interactions.
The specific language, numbers and pitch style are surprisingly important.

Now, I just need to figure out an idea I can really get behind!

Side note: [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4) is making lots of cool art assets free which makes me want to get back into game dev!
If you are interested in game dev, you should definitely check it out.
