I finally started a personal website. I followed a simple [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) which
was vey helpful. I am now using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) so I can edit in Markdown for easy updating.
This is a lot easier than writing the Ruby on Rails from scratch as I have done before...
